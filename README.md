# InfiniScreen

Developed for PennApps XVIII, InfiniScreen quickly and seamlessly links multiple smartphones to play videos across all of their screens. Breathe life into old phones by turning them into a portable TV. Make an eye-popping art piece. Display a digital sign in a way that is impossible to ignore. Or gather some friends and strangers and laugh at memes together. Creative possibilities abound.
